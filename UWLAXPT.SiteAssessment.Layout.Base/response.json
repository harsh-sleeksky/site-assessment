We also have a 30-minute block of time after lunch where we follow a similar plan for the afternoon patients. Typically, at the end of the day, we go through my notes together and apply any changes from feedback, and then we set expectations for what I should come prepared with for tomorrow. Before I leave, we conclude the day with questions and feedback from the day, and set a plan for what she wants me to have prepared for the next day."

This is working very well for me because it gives me the opportunity to have my questions answered when I have them, rather than writing them all down and waiting until only one point during the day to have them answered. For feedback, she gives me feedback on the spot if there are things I could be doing differently in the moment, as well as afterwards when the patient has left, she will check in with me and give me a run down of what she thinks I did well and what I could improve on or change for next time. This works well for me because it allows me to adjust in the moment and know exactly what I was doing wrong, and a summary at the end is a nice reminder. Prior to starting she asked me when I preferred feedback, and if it was okay to do in the moment in front of patients, which I really appreciate."

At the Ahlstom-Munksjo paper mill, we have been seeing a lot of work-related injuries. For example, it seems that the majority of the caseload is shoulder, wrist, or knee-related work injuries.",

I have done Knee flexion and extension goniometer, as well as passive knee extension and flexion. In regards to the shoulder, I have done some glenohumeral S/I & A/P joint mobilizations. In a cervical radiculopathy patient, I have performed ULTT for the median and ulnar nerve, cervical downglides, and manual traction. Additionally, I have come up with a lot of strengthening and stretching exercises for numerous musculoskeletal injuries (shoulder, hip, ankle, knee). I have been able to witness numerous upper trapezius and gastrocnemius dry needling. Also, I saw a Vertigo patient evaluation, which I found to be interesting as we have yet to learn about Vertigo in school.",

Following each session, we typically take a few minutes to reflect on how I answered the questions, what I did well, and areas for improvement. For example, following a subjective interview with a R knee pain patient. Chris mentioned that he liked that I asked the patient if they had stairs going into their house. However, he mentioned that he wishes I would’ve asked more about where exactly the patient’s pain was.",
                    "PurposeEvaluation4": "I feel prepared to be performing the duties expected of me at this stage in my academic career. For example, the first day of my clinical, I told my CI exactly what courses I have taken and have yet to take (also listed in the Manual). Therefore, it helped him get a sense of what I know and still have to learn. Additionally, my CI always asks me the day before if I have any questions, or if I want to practice any interventions with him. Subsequently, he gives me a heads up the day before exactly what is expected of me, that way I can prepare/look up anything as needed.\n\nFor example, one of the common conditions we have been seeing is cervical radiculopathy in the Darboy clinic, which I feel prepared to help treat as we just learned about this is Spine this past summer."

During all of our new patient evaluations, we step out of the room after the subjective portion and after the objective portion to talk about what diagnoses we are ruling “up” or ruling “down”.

However, I feel confident leading an initial eval (for the most part) and performing most of the manual therapy techniques that we learned.

He has put together a flow for specific joint evaluations to help with subjective / objective.  He still requires mild cueing for non-complex patients throughout their POC and requires moderate cueing and assistance with managing patients with more complex conditions. Additionally, he will continue to benefit from refining the subjective portion of his examination to ensure he is asking appropriate and thorough questions that serve to guide his clinical reasoning when deciding which objective tests and measures to perform to rule in or out certain pathologies. He will also benefit from continuing to work on displaying confidence when treating patients in order to build patient rapport and trust in his treatment plan for them.
