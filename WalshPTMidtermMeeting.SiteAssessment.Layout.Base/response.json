Workload includes approx 10-15% evals, 80% tx, and 5-10% D/C.

Other times, the family will be heavily involved in carrying out care outside of the clinic, so must be involved in the education within the clinic.  Madalyn has completed evaluations and treatments. She feels mostly comfortable with the LE pts, and is hoping to continue to focus on UE/upper spine patients in the second half to improve her confidence. Her involvement in choosing frequency/POC with knowledge of insurance and pt needs has increased in this setting. She is improving her ability to give appropriate rationale for her clinical decisions. Therex is the majority of the treatment; however, she has had the opportunity to do iontophoresis, STM, vasopneumatic compression, manual skills, and blood flow restriction training.

Finally, I have seen patients who are recovering from a major illness, such as sepsis or a COPD exacerbation, who need time in a rehabilitation facility to improve their endurance or to wean off of supplemental oxygen.\nAn entry level caseload is 5 patients per day, or 4 patients per day if all 4 are 90 minute treatments. It is expected that I be able to manage this amount of patients, as well as concurrent treatments as treatment sessions often overlap each day. I would be expected to split all evaluations and/or discharges in a day with other evaluating therapists and comfortably perform family instructions as needed. Additionally, if we have an unusually low caseload or are unable to fill our schedule on rehab, it would be expected that an entry-level clinician be comfortable performing evaluations on the acute care floors as well.",

Expectations for a new clinician would be 1 hour for evaluations and 1 hour for treatments. On long days, Taylor is currently managing ~50% of the caseload on her own (6 patients are hers with 3 in the AM and 3 in the PM), she is also called to assist for an additional 2-3 patients (not leading, but may provide a portion of an intervention with direct supervision / assist from CI - for more complex patient cases).

Tim states he doesn't believe Cole won't achieve performance expectations, but he wants Cole to be as good as possible. To date, CI has not been overly direct in communicating concerns.  I spoke with Cole at length today re: behaviors that CI reported. I think Cole has the ability to modify his communication and be more open with CI instead of being reserved.
